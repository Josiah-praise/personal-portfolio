# Starter Template or Existing Project

**Decision:** N/A - Greenfield project

This is a greenfield Next.js 14+ portfolio project with a fully specified tech stack (Next.js App Router, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, shadcn/ui, Vercel deployment). While starter templates exist (Vercel's Next.js Portfolio Starter, shadcn/ui Taxonomy), proceeding greenfield provides complete control and maintains a lean codebase optimized for the specific requirements outlined in the PRD.

**Key Constraints:**
- Next.js 14+ with App Router (required)
- Static Site Generation (SSG) primary strategy
- Vercel deployment platform
- Budget: $0-50/year (free tier optimization)
- Performance targets: Lighthouse scores 90+ across all categories
