# Developer Portfolio Product Requirements Document (PRD)

## Goals and Background Context

### Goals

- Create a professional, high-performance portfolio website that effectively showcases developer skills and projects to potential employers and clients
- Achieve measurable career advancement through 3-5 quality inbound opportunities within 3 months of launch
- Establish strong personal brand presence with top 3 Google search rankings for "[Developer Name] + developer" within 6 months
- Demonstrate technical excellence through the portfolio itself (performance, accessibility, modern tech stack)
- Provide compelling project case studies that tell the story of problem-solving approach, not just code
- Enable easy discovery and contact by recruiters, hiring managers, and potential clients
- Build a scalable foundation that can evolve with the developer's career

### Background Context

Many developers struggle to stand out in today's competitive tech job market. Traditional resumes fail to capture the full breadth of capabilities, and scattered online presence across platforms like GitHub and LinkedIn makes it difficult for employers to assess real-world project quality and cultural fit. Generic portfolio templates lack personalization, and many existing portfolios suffer from poor performance, outdated design, or ineffective storytelling.

This portfolio addresses these challenges by serving as a centralized, professional showcase that combines technical demonstration with compelling narrative. By building a custom portfolio using modern frameworks and best practices, the developer proves their capabilities through the portfolio itself while making it easy for interested parties to discover their work, understand their approach, and initiate contact.

## User Interface Design Goals

### Overall UX Vision

The portfolio should feel professional, clean, and modern while reflecting the developer's personal brand and technical sophistication. The user experience prioritizes clarity and ease of navigation, allowing recruiters to quickly find key information (skills, projects, contact) while also inviting deeper exploration of project case studies for those who want detail. The design should demonstrate attention to detail and user-centric thinking through smooth interactions, clear hierarchy, and intuitive information architecture. Performance should be imperceptible - no loading spinners, no janky scrolling, just seamless content delivery.

### Key Interaction Paradigms

- **Scroll-based narrative:** Primary navigation uses smooth scrolling through sections on the homepage, with clear visual transitions between content areas
- **Progressive disclosure:** Project showcases present summary cards initially, expanding to full case studies on click/tap
- **Mobile-first interactions:** Touch-friendly targets (minimum 44x44px), swipe gestures for image galleries on mobile
- **Minimal cognitive load:** No more than 3 clicks to reach any information; clear call-to-action buttons (View Project, Download Resume, Contact Me)
- **Fast feedback:** Immediate visual feedback for all interactions (button states, form validation, loading indicators when necessary)
- **Accessibility-first:** Keyboard navigation fully supported, screen reader friendly, sufficient color contrast

### Core Screens and Views

- **Landing/Home Page:** Hero section with introduction, About preview, Featured Projects grid, Skills overview, Contact CTA
- **About Page/Section:** Full developer story, journey, values, downloadable resume
- **Project Detail Pages:** Individual pages or modals for each featured project with comprehensive case study
- **Contact Page/Section:** Contact form or clear contact information display
- **404/Error Page:** Branded error page with navigation back to home

### Accessibility: WCAG AA

The portfolio will meet WCAG 2.1 Level AA standards to ensure usability for people with disabilities and demonstrate professional commitment to inclusive design. This includes proper semantic HTML, sufficient color contrast ratios, keyboard navigation, focus indicators, alt text for images, and screen reader compatibility.

### Branding

Professional and modern aesthetic with clean typography and purposeful use of whitespace. Color scheme will be refined and professional (likely neutral base with one or two accent colors). Typography will use modern, highly legible system fonts or Google Fonts. Overall feel should be "confident, capable, approachable" - not flashy or over-designed, but showing good taste and technical polish.

### Target Device and Platforms: Web Responsive

The portfolio must provide excellent experience across:
- **Desktop:** 1024px and wider (primary experience for recruiters at work)
- **Tablet:** 768px-1023px (secondary, growing segment)
- **Mobile:** 320px-767px (significant traffic, especially for casual browsing)

All modern browsers supported (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge - latest 2 versions).

## Technical Assumptions

### Repository Structure: Monorepo

Single repository containing all portfolio code, assets, and content. This simplifies deployment, version control, and maintenance for a solo developer project.

### Service Architecture

**Static Site Generation (SSG) with Next.js App Router**

The portfolio will be built as a statically generated site using Next.js 14+ with the App Router. Pages will be pre-rendered at build time for optimal performance and SEO. A serverless function will handle contact form submissions.

**Architecture components:**
- Next.js static site (pre-rendered pages)
- Serverless API route for contact form (/api/contact)
- Content managed through code (TypeScript/MDX files or JSON)
- Hosted on Vercel (optimal Next.js deployment platform with free tier)

### Testing Requirements

**Unit + Integration Testing**

- **Unit tests:** Component testing with React Testing Library for UI components
- **Integration tests:** API route testing for contact form functionality
- **Manual testing:** Visual QA and cross-browser testing before launch
- **Lighthouse CI:** Automated performance/accessibility testing in CI/CD pipeline

- Version controlled in Git for complete change history

**Form Handling:**
- Next.js API route (/api/contact) processes form submissions
- Email service: **Resend** or **SendGrid** free tier for email delivery
- Spam protection: **Honeypot technique** (avoid reCAPTCHA for better UX and free operation)

**Image Optimization:**
- Next.js Image component for automatic optimization
- Images stored in /public or external CDN
- WebP format with fallbacks

**Analytics:**
- **Vercel Analytics** (free, privacy-focused, no cookie consent required) or **Google Analytics 4** (more comprehensive but requires cookie consent)

**SEO:**
- Next.js Metadata API for SEO tags
- Sitemap and robots.txt automatically generated
- Open Graph and Twitter Card meta tags for social sharing

**Deployment & Hosting:**
- **Vercel** free tier (seamless Next.js integration, automatic deployments from Git, global CDN)
- Custom domain ($10-15/year for domain registration)
- HTTPS automatic through Vercel

**Version Control:**

## Content Management Strategy

### Overview

Projects and content will be managed as code using MDX (Markdown + JSX) files with TypeScript-validated frontmatter. This approach provides version control, type safety, and developer-friendly editing without requiring a database or CMS.

### Directory Structure

```
/content
  /projects
    - project-1-ecommerce-platform.mdx
    - project-2-task-manager.mdx
    - project-3-weather-app.mdx
    - _template.mdx                    # Template for new projects
  /data
    - skills.ts                        # Skills list
    - about.ts                         # About page content
    - social-links.ts                  # Social media links
  - _IMAGE_GUIDELINES.md               # Image specifications
  - README.md                          # Content management guide
```

### Project MDX Format

Each project is a self-contained MDX file with frontmatter metadata and Markdown content:

**Frontmatter Schema:**
```typescript
interface ProjectFrontmatter {
  title: string;                      // Project name
  slug: string;                       // URL-friendly identifier
  description: string;                // Brief one-liner (50-100 chars)
  featured: boolean;                  // Show on homepage?
  order: number;                      // Display order (1, 2, 3...)
  technologies: string[];             // Tech stack array
  category: 'Frontend' | 'Full-Stack' | 'Backend' | 'Mobile' | 'DevOps';
  startDate: string;                  // YYYY-MM format
  endDate: string | 'Present';        // YYYY-MM or "Present"
  demoUrl?: string;                   // Live demo URL (optional)
  githubUrl?: string;                 // GitHub repo URL (optional)
  thumbnail: string;                  // Path to thumbnail image
  images: string[];                   // Array of screenshot paths
}
```

**Content Structure:**
- **The Problem**: 2-3 sentences describing the challenge
- **The Solution**: Paragraph explaining the approach
- **Key Features**: Bulleted list of main capabilities
- **Technical Highlights**: Implementation details and decisions
- **Results**: Measurable outcomes and impact

### Adding a New Project Workflow

**Step 1: Create MDX File**
```bash
cp content/projects/_template.mdx content/projects/my-new-project.mdx
```

**Step 2: Edit Frontmatter and Content**
```mdx
---
title: "My New Project"
slug: "my-new-project"
description: "Full-stack application for managing tasks with real-time collaboration"
featured: true
order: 1
technologies: ["Next.js", "TypeScript", "PostgreSQL", "WebSockets"]
category: "Full-Stack"
startDate: "2024-08"
endDate: "2024-10"
demoUrl: "https://demo.example.com"
githubUrl: "https://github.com/username/project"
thumbnail: "/images/projects/my-new-project/thumbnail.jpg"
images:
  - "/images/projects/my-new-project/screenshot-1.jpg"
  - "/images/projects/my-new-project/screenshot-2.jpg"
---

## The Problem
[Describe the problem this project solves...]

## The Solution
[Explain your approach...]
```

**Step 3: Add Images**
```bash
mkdir -p public/images/projects/my-new-project
# Add optimized images to this directory
```

**Step 4: Commit and Deploy**
```bash
git add content/projects/my-new-project.mdx
git add public/images/projects/my-new-project/
git commit -m "Add new project: My New Project"
git push
# Vercel automatically builds and deploys
```

### Image Specifications

**Required Images per Project:**
- **Thumbnail**: 600x400px, WebP format preferred, max 200KB
- **Screenshots**: 1200x800px minimum, WebP format preferred, max 500KB each
- **Count**: 1 thumbnail + 3-5 screenshots per project

**Naming Convention:**
- Use kebab-case: `project-name-screen-description.webp`
- Examples: `ecommerce-home-page.webp`, `dashboard-analytics-view.webp`

**Storage Location:**
```
/public/images/projects/[project-slug]/
  - thumbnail.webp
  - screenshot-1.webp
  - screenshot-2.webp
  - screenshot-3.webp
```

**Optimization Guidelines:**
1. Resize to target dimensions (use Squoosh.app or similar)
2. Convert to WebP format
3. Compress to target file size
4. Include descriptive alt text in MDX

### Skills Management

Skills are managed in a TypeScript file for type safety and easy updates:

**`/content/data/skills.ts`:**
```typescript
export interface SkillCategory {
  name: string;
  skills: string[];
}

export const skills: SkillCategory[] = [
  {
    name: "Languages",
    skills: ["JavaScript", "TypeScript", "Python", "Go"]
  },
  {
    name: "Frontend",
    skills: ["React", "Next.js", "Tailwind CSS", "shadcn/ui"]
  },
  {
    name: "Backend",
    skills: ["Node.js", "Express", "PostgreSQL", "Redis"]
  },
  {
    name: "Tools & Practices",
    skills: ["Git", "Docker", "CI/CD", "Agile", "Testing"]
  }
];
```

**To update skills:** Edit the file and add/remove items from the arrays, then commit.

### Content Loading Implementation

**Utility for Loading Projects:**
```typescript
// /lib/content/projects.ts
import fs from 'fs';
import path from 'path';
import matter from 'gray-matter';
import { serialize } from 'next-mdx-remote/serialize';

const projectsDirectory = path.join(process.cwd(), 'content/projects');

export async function getAllProjects() {
  const fileNames = fs.readdirSync(projectsDirectory);

  const projects = await Promise.all(
    fileNames
      .filter(fileName => fileName.endsWith('.mdx'))
      .map(async (fileName) => {
        const slug = fileName.replace(/\.mdx$/, '');
        const fullPath = path.join(projectsDirectory, fileName);
        const fileContents = fs.readFileSync(fullPath, 'utf8');

        const { data, content } = matter(fileContents);
        const mdxSource = await serialize(content);

        return { ...data, slug, content: mdxSource };
      })
  );

  return projects.sort((a, b) => {
    if (a.featured && !b.featured) return -1;
    if (!a.featured && b.featured) return 1;
    return a.order - b.order;
  });
}

export async function getFeaturedProjects() {
  const projects = await getAllProjects();
  return projects.filter(p => p.featured).slice(0, 5);
}
```
