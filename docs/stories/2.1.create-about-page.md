## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
[From Stories 1.1-1.6]
- Next.js 14+ with App Router, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS configured
- shadcn/ui components available (Button, Card)
- Global layout with Header and Footer implemented
- Navigation includes "About" link (Story 1.6)
- Hero section on homepage provides initial introduction

### Routing Architecture
[Source: [frontend-architecture.md#routing-architecture](docs/architecture/frontend-architecture.md)]

**Route Structure:**
- About page: `app/about/page.tsx`
- Accessible via: `/about`
- Navigation already includes link to this route (implemented in Story 1.6)

**Page Component Pattern:**
```typescript
// app/about/page.tsx
export const metadata = {
  title: 'About | Your Name',
  description: '...'
};

export default function AboutPage() {
  return (
    <article className="container mx-auto px-4 py-12">
      {/* Page content */}
    </article>
  );
}
```

### Component Architecture
[Source: [frontend-architecture.md#component-organization](docs/architecture/frontend-architecture.md)]

**Page Organization:**
- About page is a route-level component in `app/about/page.tsx`
- Can extract reusable sections to `/components/sections/` if needed
- Keep page component simple, delegate complex UI to child components

### Content Strategy

**Background Story Content:**
- Keep authentic and personable
- Focus on journey, not just credentials
- Include motivations and passions
- 2-4 paragraphs maximum

**Core Competencies:**
- Technical skills: 4-6 key technical strengths
- Soft skills: 3-4 professional qualities
- Make scannable (grid, list, or cards)

**Experience Summary:**
- High-level overview, not detailed resume
- 2-3 paragraphs or bullet points
- Link to downloadable resume for full details (Story 2.2)

### Coding Standards
[Source: [coding-standards.md#critical-fullstack-rules](docs/architecture/coding-standards.md)]

**Type Safety:**
- Page component uses TypeScript
- Metadata object properly typed

**Semantic HTML:**
- Use `<article>` for main content
- Use `<section>` for distinct content areas
- Proper heading hierarchy (h1 → h2 → h3)

**Image Optimization:**
- Always use Next.js Image component
- Include width, height, and alt text
- Use WebP format for images

### Responsive Design
[Source: [tech-stack.md](docs/architecture/tech-stack.md)]

**Layout Strategy:**
- Mobile: Single column, stacked sections
- Tablet (md:): Two-column where appropriate (image + text)
- Desktop (lg:): Wider content container, optimized spacing

**Tailwind Breakpoints:**
- Base (mobile): Default styles
- md: (768px+): Tablet adjustments
- lg: (1024px+): Desktop optimizations

### Typography and Styling

**Typography Scale:**
```css
h1: text-4xl md:text-5xl font-bold
h2: text-2xl md:text-3xl font-semibold mt-12 mb-6
h3: text-xl md:text-2xl font-medium mt-8 mb-4
p: text-base md:text-lg leading-relaxed
```

**Color Scheme (shadcn/ui variables):**
- Headings: `text-foreground`
- Body text: `text-muted-foreground`
- Sections: `bg-background`

### SEO Metadata
[Source: [frontend-architecture.md#routing-architecture](docs/architecture/frontend-architecture.md)]

**Page Metadata:**
```typescript
export const metadata = {
  title: 'About | Your Name',
  description: 'Learn about my journey as a full-stack developer, my core competencies, and professional background.'
};
```

### File Locations

Based on project structure:
- About page: `app/about/page.tsx`
- Images (if any): `public/images/about/` or reuse `public/images/avatar.webp`

### Testing

[Source: [testing-strategy.md](docs/architecture/testing-strategy.md)]

**Testing Requirements for this Story:**
- Manual verification:
  - Page renders correctly at all breakpoints
  - Typography is readable and well-spaced
  - Navigation link works correctly
  - Images (if any) load optimally
- Lighthouse audit: Accessibility 100, SEO 100, Performance 90+
- Future: E2E test for navigation to About page

### Accessibility Requirements

**WCAG Compliance:**
- Semantic HTML structure
- Proper heading hierarchy (h1 → h2, no skipping levels)
- Sufficient color contrast (4.5:1 for normal text)
- Images have descriptive alt text
- Content is keyboard navigable

### Content Data Location
[Source: [unified-project-structure.md](docs/architecture/unified-project-structure.md)]

**Static Content:**
- About page content can be hardcoded in page component
- Alternatively, create `content/data/about.ts` for content management:
  ```typescript
  export const aboutContent = {
    story: "...",
    competencies: [...],
    experience: "..."
  };
  ```

### Integration with Future Stories

This About page provides:
- Professional background and context for visitors
- Foundation for downloadable resume link (Story 2.2)
- Personal connection point before viewing projects
- SEO content for search engines
