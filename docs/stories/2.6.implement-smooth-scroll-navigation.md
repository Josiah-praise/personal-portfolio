# Story 2.6: Implement Smooth Scroll Navigation (If Single-Page Design)

## Status
Draft

## Story

**As a** visitor,
**I want** navigation to smoothly scroll to different sections,
**so that** the browsing experience feels polished and intentional.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. Navigation links trigger smooth scroll to corresponding sections (if single-page design)
2. Scroll behavior is smooth and not jarring (appropriate duration/easing)
3. URL hash updates to reflect current section (e.g., #about, #projects)
4. Active navigation link updates as user scrolls through sections
5. Scroll behavior works on all devices and browsers
6. Keyboard navigation (Tab + Enter) also triggers smooth scroll
7. If multi-page design: page transitions are smooth without harsh loading states

## Tasks / Subtasks

- [ ] Determine portfolio architecture (AC: 1, 7)
  - [ ] Review current implementation from Stories 1.6, 2.1-2.5
  - [ ] Confirm: Portfolio is **multi-page design** (separate routes for About, Projects, Contact)
  - [ ] Decision: This story focuses on **smooth page transitions** for multi-page design
  - [ ] Note: Smooth scroll within pages (e.g., anchor links) can be added if needed

- [ ] Enable CSS smooth scrolling (AC: 2, 5)
  - [ ] Open `app/globals.css`
  - [ ] Add smooth scroll behavior to html element:
    ```css
    html {
      scroll-behavior: smooth;
    }
    ```
  - [ ] This enables smooth scrolling for anchor links and programmatic scrolls
  - [ ] Test browser support: Works in all modern browsers

- [ ] Configure Next.js page transitions (AC: 7)
  - [ ] Review Next.js App Router page transitions
  - [ ] Note: Next.js App Router provides instant navigation by default
  - [ ] Page transitions are already smooth (no full page reload)
  - [ ] Verify navigation between pages feels smooth
  - [ ] Optional: Add loading state for slow connections (future enhancement)

- [ ] Add scroll-margin for anchor links (if needed) (AC: 2)
  - [ ] If header is sticky, add scroll-margin to prevent content hiding under header
  - [ ] Add to globals.css:
    ```css
    :target {
      scroll-margin-top: 80px; /* Adjust based on header height */
    }
    ```
  - [ ] This ensures anchored sections don't hide behind fixed header

- [ ] Test smooth scrolling behavior (AC: 2, 5, 6)
  - [ ] Run `npm run dev`
  - [ ] Navigate between pages (Home, About, Projects, Contact)
  - [ ] Verify page transitions are instant and smooth
  - [ ] Test keyboard navigation: Tab to nav link, Enter to navigate
  - [ ] Test on different browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari)
  - [ ] Test on mobile devices for smooth transitions

- [ ] Optional: Add anchor links within pages (AC: 1, 3, 4)
  - [ ] If About page or other pages have multiple sections
  - [ ] Add id attributes to sections: `<section id="experience">...</section>`
  - [ ] Create anchor links: `<a href="#experience">Jump to Experience</a>`
  - [ ] Verify smooth scroll works with CSS scroll-behavior
  - [ ] Update URL hash when section is clicked
  - [ ] Note: Full scroll-spy navigation (AC: 4) not needed for multi-page design

- [ ] Optional: Add loading indicator for page transitions (AC: 7)
  - [ ] Install nprogress or use Next.js built-in loading state
  - [ ] Create loading component at `app/loading.tsx`
  - [ ] Add simple loading spinner or progress bar
  - [ ] Test with slow network throttling in DevTools
  - [ ] Note: Can skip for MVP (Next.js navigation is very fast)

- [ ] Test accessibility (AC: 6)
  - [ ] Verify keyboard navigation works (Tab + Enter)
  - [ ] Test with screen reader (optional)
  - [ ] Ensure focus management works correctly on page navigation
  - [ ] Run Lighthouse audit for accessibility

- [ ] Verify cross-browser compatibility (AC: 5)
  - [ ] Test in Chrome (scroll-behavior supported)
  - [ ] Test in Firefox (scroll-behavior supported)
  - [ ] Test in Safari (scroll-behavior supported)
  - [ ] Test in Edge (scroll-behavior supported)
  - [ ] Note: IE11 doesn't support scroll-behavior (acceptable, no fallback needed)

- [ ] Deploy and verify live (AC: 1-7)
  - [ ] Commit changes: `git add .` and `git commit -m "Add smooth scroll behavior and polish page transitions"`
  - [ ] Push to main: `git push origin main`
  - [ ] Verify Vercel deployment succeeds
  - [ ] Test page navigation on production URL
  - [ ] Verify smooth scrolling works on live site

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
[From Stories 1.1-1.6, 2.1-2.5]
- Portfolio uses **multi-page design** (not single-page app)
- Separate routes: / (Home), /about, /projects, /contact
- Navigation implemented with Next.js Link (Story 1.6)
- Next.js App Router provides instant client-side navigation

### Architecture Decision: Multi-Page vs Single-Page

**Current Implementation: Multi-Page**
- Separate routes for each section
- Next.js App Router handles navigation
- Each page is a distinct route with its own URL

**This Story Adaptation:**
- Focus on smooth page transitions (AC: 7)
- Add CSS smooth-scroll for any anchor links
- No scroll-spy navigation needed (not single-page)

### CSS Smooth Scroll Implementation

**globals.css Addition:**
```css
html {
  scroll-behavior: smooth;
}

/* If header is sticky, prevent content hiding under header */
:target {
  scroll-margin-top: 80px; /* Adjust to header height */
}
```

**Browser Support:**
- Chrome: ✅ Supported
- Firefox: ✅ Supported
- Safari: ✅ Supported
- Edge: ✅ Supported
- IE11: ❌ Not supported (acceptable fallback: instant scroll)

### Next.js Page Transition Behavior

**App Router Navigation:**
- Client-side navigation (no full page reload)
- Instant page transitions
- Prefetching enabled by default for visible links
- Loading state can be customized with loading.tsx

**Smooth Transitions:**
- Already smooth by default
- No additional configuration needed
- Optional: Add loading indicator for slow connections

### Optional: Loading State

**If Adding Loading Indicator:**
```tsx
// app/loading.tsx
export default function Loading() {
  return (
    <div className="flex items-center justify-center min-h-screen">
      <div className="animate-spin h-8 w-8 border-4 border-primary border-t-transparent rounded-full" />
    </div>
  );
}
```

### Anchor Links Within Pages

**If Using Anchor Links:**
```tsx
// Within a page component
<section id="experience">
  <h2>Experience</h2>
  {/* Content */}
</section>

// Link to anchor
<a href="#experience">Jump to Experience</a>
```

**Smooth Scroll Behavior:**
- Enabled by `scroll-behavior: smooth` in CSS
- Works automatically with anchor links
- No JavaScript required

### Scroll-Spy Navigation (Not Required)

**For Single-Page Apps:**
- Detects current section while scrolling
- Updates active navigation link
- Not needed for multi-page design

**If Implementing Later:**
- Use Intersection Observer API
- Detect visible sections
- Update active state in navigation

### Coding Standards
[Source: [coding-standards.md](docs/architecture/coding-standards.md)]

**CSS Best Practices:**
- Add global styles to globals.css
- Use CSS variables from shadcn/ui theme
- Keep CSS minimal (leverage Tailwind)

### Accessibility Considerations

**Keyboard Navigation:**
- Next.js Link is keyboard accessible by default
- Tab to link, Enter to navigate
- Focus management handled by Next.js

**Screen Readers:**
- Page navigation announced by screen readers
- ARIA live regions for loading states (if added)

### Testing

[Source: [testing-strategy.md](docs/architecture/testing-strategy.md)]

**Testing Requirements for this Story:**
- Manual verification:
  - Page transitions are smooth and instant
  - Anchor links (if any) scroll smoothly
  - Keyboard navigation works
  - Cross-browser compatibility
- Lighthouse audit: Performance 90+, Accessibility 100

### Performance Optimization

**Next.js Optimizations:**
- Link prefetching (automatic for visible links)
- Client-side navigation (no full page reload)
- Optimized bundle sizes

**CSS Performance:**
- scroll-behavior: smooth is performant
- No JavaScript needed for basic smooth scroll

### Browser Compatibility

**scroll-behavior: smooth Support:**
- Modern browsers: ✅ Full support
- IE11: ❌ No support (fallback: instant scroll)
- Mobile browsers: ✅ Full support

**Fallback Behavior:**
- Browsers without support use instant scroll
- No polyfill needed (acceptable degradation)

### Integration with Future Stories

This smooth navigation provides:
- Polished user experience
- Professional feel to portfolio
- Foundation for enhanced animations (future)
- Accessibility compliance

### Alternative: Framer Motion (Future Enhancement)

**If Adding Advanced Animations:**
- Install framer-motion: `npm install framer-motion`
- Add page transition animations
- Animate component entrance/exit
- Note: Keep simple for MVP, add later if desired

### Technical Constraints

**CSS Smooth Scroll:**
- No control over duration or easing
- Browser default animation (acceptable)
- Can override with JavaScript if needed (future)

**Next.js Navigation:**
- Fast by default, no customization needed
- Loading states optional (add if slow connections are concern)
