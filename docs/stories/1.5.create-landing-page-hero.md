## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
[From Stories 1.1, 1.2, 1.3, 1.4]
- Next.js 14+ with TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, and shadcn/ui configured
- Button and Card components installed from shadcn/ui
- Project deployed to Vercel with automatic deployments on push
- Folder structure: /app, /components (with /ui and future /sections), /lib, /public

### Component Architecture Requirements
[Source: [frontend-architecture.md#component-organization](docs/architecture/frontend-architecture.md)]

**Component Location:**
- Hero component: `components/sections/hero.tsx`
- Section components stored in `/components/sections/`
- Components use PascalCase naming

**Component Structure:**
```typescript
// components/sections/hero.tsx
import Image from 'next/image';
import Link from 'next/link';
import { Button } from '@/components/ui/button';

export function Hero() {
  return (
    <section aria-label="Hero" className="...">
      {/* Hero content */}
    </section>
  );
}
```

### Coding Standards
[Source: [coding-standards.md#critical-fullstack-rules](docs/architecture/coding-standards.md)]

**Component Guidelines:**
- TypeScript with explicit types (component props, event handlers)
- No `any` types
- Server components by default (no 'use client' unless needed)
- Always use Next.js Image component, never `<img>` tags
- Include alt text for all images (accessibility requirement)

**Naming Conventions:**
- Component: PascalCase → `Hero.tsx`
- File: kebab-case → `hero.tsx`
- Image file: lowercase with hyphens → `avatar.webp`, `profile-photo.webp`

### Image Optimization Requirements
[Source: [coding-standards.md#critical-fullstack-rules](docs/architecture/coding-standards.md)]

**Next.js Image Component:**
- Always use `next/image` for optimization
- Provide width and height (or fill for responsive)
- Use `priority={true}` for above-fold images (hero section)
- Alt text required for accessibility
- Recommended format: WebP for smaller file sizes

**Image Location:**
- Store in: `public/images/avatar.webp`
- Reference as: `/images/avatar.webp` (public/ is root for static files)

### Responsive Design Strategy
[Source: [tech-stack.md](docs/architecture/tech-stack.md)]

**Tailwind Breakpoints:**
- sm: 640px (mobile landscape)
- md: 768px (tablet)
- lg: 1024px (desktop)
- xl: 1280px (large desktop)

**Mobile-First Approach:**
- Base styles for mobile (default, no prefix)
- Add responsive modifiers for larger screens (md:, lg:, xl:)

### Typography Hierarchy
[Source: [coding-standards.md](docs/architecture/coding-standards.md)]

**Semantic HTML:**
- h1: Developer name (only one h1 per page)
- h2 or p: Tagline/value proposition
- p: Introduction text

**Tailwind Typography Classes (Example):**
- h1: `text-4xl md:text-5xl lg:text-6xl font-bold`
- h2/tagline: `text-xl md:text-2xl text-muted-foreground`
- p: `text-base md:text-lg leading-relaxed`

### Accessibility Standards
[Source: [coding-standards.md#critical-fullstack-rules](docs/architecture/coding-standards.md)]

**Requirements:**
- Semantic HTML elements (section, h1, h2, p, button)
- ARIA labels where needed (aria-label for section)
- Sufficient color contrast (WCAG AA: 4.5:1 for normal text)
- Keyboard accessible (all interactive elements reachable via Tab)
- Descriptive alt text for images

### Integration with shadcn/ui Theme
[Source: [components.md#ui-component-library-shadcnui](docs/architecture/components.md)]

**CSS Variables:**
- Background: `bg-background`
- Foreground text: `text-foreground`
- Muted text: `text-muted-foreground`
- Primary button: Button component uses theme automatically

### File Locations

Based on project structure:
- Hero component: `components/sections/hero.tsx`
- Homepage: `app/page.tsx`
- Image: `public/images/avatar.webp`

### Testing

[Source: [testing-strategy.md](docs/architecture/testing-strategy.md)]

**Testing Requirements for this Story:**
- Manual verification:
  - Hero section renders on homepage
  - All text displays correctly and is readable
  - Image loads and is optimized (check Network tab in DevTools)
  - Button navigates to correct route
  - Responsive layout works at all breakpoints
  - Keyboard navigation functions properly
- Lighthouse audit: Accessibility score 100, Performance 90+
- Future: Component test with React Testing Library (Epic 2+)

### Content Placeholder Examples

**Developer Name:** "Your Name" or actual name
**Tagline:** "Full-Stack Developer | React & TypeScript Specialist"
**Introduction:** "I build modern web applications with a focus on performance, accessibility, and exceptional user experiences."
**CTA Text:** "View Projects" (links to /projects) or "Get in Touch" (links to /contact)

### Technical Constraints

**Performance Considerations:**
- Hero section is above the fold → use Image priority={true}
- Avoid large unoptimized images (Next.js Image handles this)
- Minimize layout shift (CLS) by providing image dimensions

### Integration with Future Stories

This hero section provides:
- First impression for all visitors
- Navigation entry point via CTA button
- Foundation for homepage design (will be complemented by projects preview in Epic 2)
- Professional branding that carries through entire portfolio
