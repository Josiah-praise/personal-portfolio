# Story 1.5: Create Landing Page Hero Section

## Status
Draft

## Story

**As a** visitor,
**I want** to see an impactful hero section with developer introduction when I first visit the portfolio,
**so that** I immediately understand who the developer is and what they offer.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. Hero section displays developer name prominently
2. Professional tagline or value proposition visible (e.g., "Full-Stack Developer specializing in React & Node.js")
3. Brief 1-2 sentence introduction displayed
4. Placeholder or actual professional photo included with Next.js Image optimization
5. Primary CTA button present (e.g., "View Projects" or "Get in Touch")
6. Hero section is fully responsive (mobile, tablet, desktop)
7. Typography hierarchy is clear and professional
8. Section meets accessibility standards (semantic HTML, alt text for image)
9. Page successfully deploys to Vercel and is accessible via live URL

    - [ ] alt: "Your Name - Full-Stack Developer" (descriptive for accessibility)
    - [ ] width and height props (e.g., 400x400)

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
[From Stories 1.1, 1.2, 1.3, 1.4]
- Next.js 14+ with TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, and shadcn/ui configured
- Button and Card components installed from shadcn/ui
- Project deployed to Vercel with automatic deployments on push
- Folder structure: /app, /components (with /ui and future /sections), /lib, /public

### Component Architecture Requirements
[Source: [frontend-architecture.md#component-organization](docs/architecture/frontend-architecture.md)]

**Component Location:**
- Hero component: `components/sections/hero.tsx`
- Section components stored in `/components/sections/`
- Components use PascalCase naming

**Component Structure:**
```typescript
// components/sections/hero.tsx
import Image from 'next/image';
import Link from 'next/link';
import { Button } from '@/components/ui/button';

export function Hero() {
  return (
    <section aria-label="Hero" className="...">
      {/* Hero content */}
    </section>
  );
}
```

### Coding Standards
[Source: [coding-standards.md#critical-fullstack-rules](docs/architecture/coding-standards.md)]

**Component Guidelines:**
- TypeScript with explicit types (component props, event handlers)
- No `any` types
- Server components by default (no 'use client' unless needed)
- Always use Next.js Image component, never `<img>` tags
- Include alt text for all images (accessibility requirement)

**Naming Conventions:**
- Component: PascalCase → `Hero.tsx`
- File: kebab-case → `hero.tsx`
- Image file: lowercase with hyphens → `avatar.webp`, `profile-photo.webp`

### Image Optimization Requirements
[Source: [coding-standards.md#critical-fullstack-rules](docs/architecture/coding-standards.md)]

**Next.js Image Component:**
- Always use `next/image` for optimization
- Provide width and height (or fill for responsive)
- Use `priority={true}` for above-fold images (hero section)
- Alt text required for accessibility
- Recommended format: WebP for smaller file sizes

**Image Location:**
- Store in: `public/images/avatar.webp`
- Reference as: `/images/avatar.webp` (public/ is root for static files)

### Responsive Design Strategy
[Source: [tech-stack.md](docs/architecture/tech-stack.md)]

**Tailwind Breakpoints:**
- sm: 640px (mobile landscape)
- md: 768px (tablet)
- lg: 1024px (desktop)
- xl: 1280px (large desktop)

**Mobile-First Approach:**
- Base styles for mobile (default, no prefix)
- Add responsive modifiers for larger screens (md:, lg:, xl:)

### Typography Hierarchy
[Source: [coding-standards.md](docs/architecture/coding-standards.md)]

**Semantic HTML:**
- h1: Developer name (only one h1 per page)
- h2 or p: Tagline/value proposition
- p: Introduction text

**Tailwind Typography Classes (Example):**
- h1: `text-4xl md:text-5xl lg:text-6xl font-bold`
- h2/tagline: `text-xl md:text-2xl text-muted-foreground`
- p: `text-base md:text-lg leading-relaxed`

### Accessibility Standards
[Source: [coding-standards.md#critical-fullstack-rules](docs/architecture/coding-standards.md)]

**Requirements:**
- Semantic HTML elements (section, h1, h2, p, button)
- ARIA labels where needed (aria-label for section)
- Sufficient color contrast (WCAG AA: 4.5:1 for normal text)
- Keyboard accessible (all interactive elements reachable via Tab)
- Descriptive alt text for images

### Integration with shadcn/ui Theme
[Source: [components.md#ui-component-library-shadcnui](docs/architecture/components.md)]

**CSS Variables:**
- Background: `bg-background`
- Foreground text: `text-foreground`
- Muted text: `text-muted-foreground`
- Primary button: Button component uses theme automatically

### File Locations

Based on project structure:
- Hero component: `components/sections/hero.tsx`
- Homepage: `app/page.tsx`
- Image: `public/images/avatar.webp`

### Testing

[Source: [testing-strategy.md](docs/architecture/testing-strategy.md)]

**Testing Requirements for this Story:**
- Manual verification:
  - Hero section renders on homepage
  - All text displays correctly and is readable
  - Image loads and is optimized (check Network tab in DevTools)
  - Button navigates to correct route
  - Responsive layout works at all breakpoints
  - Keyboard navigation functions properly
- Lighthouse audit: Accessibility score 100, Performance 90+
- Future: Component test with React Testing Library (Epic 2+)

### Content Placeholder Examples

**Developer Name:** "Your Name" or actual name
**Tagline:** "Full-Stack Developer | React & TypeScript Specialist"
**Introduction:** "I build modern web applications with a focus on performance, accessibility, and exceptional user experiences."
**CTA Text:** "View Projects" (links to /projects) or "Get in Touch" (links to /contact)

### Technical Constraints

**Performance Considerations:**
- Hero section is above the fold → use Image priority={true}
- Avoid large unoptimized images (Next.js Image handles this)
- Minimize layout shift (CLS) by providing image dimensions

### Integration with Future Stories

This hero section provides:
- First impression for all visitors
- Navigation entry point via CTA button
- Foundation for homepage design (will be complemented by projects preview in Epic 2)
- Professional branding that carries through entire portfolio
