## Problem

Small businesses often struggle with expensive, complex e-commerce solutions that require technical expertise to maintain. Many platforms charge high monthly fees and transaction costs, making it difficult for startups to establish an online presence. The goal was to create an affordable, user-friendly e-commerce solution that small business owners could set up and manage themselves.

## Solution

I built a full-stack e-commerce platform using Next.js and TypeScript for type-safe, performant frontend development. The architecture leverages server-side rendering for SEO benefits and fast initial page loads, while client-side state management handles the shopping cart and checkout flow.

Key technical decisions included choosing PostgreSQL for relational data integrity, implementing Stripe for secure payment processing, and using Next.js API routes as a lightweight backend. The design prioritizes mobile responsiveness, as over 60% of online shopping occurs on mobile devices.

## Key Features

- **Secure Payment Processing:** Integrated Stripe checkout with PCI compliance and support for multiple payment methods
- **Real-time Inventory Management:** Automatic stock tracking and low-inventory alerts to prevent overselling
- **Admin Dashboard:** Intuitive interface for product management, order tracking, and analytics
- **Responsive Design:** Mobile-first approach ensuring seamless experience across all devices
- **SEO Optimization:** Server-side rendering and structured data for better search engine visibility

## Technologies Used

**Frontend:** Next.js 14, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS for rapid UI development with type safety

**Backend:** Next.js API Routes, Node.js for serverless function deployment

**Database:** PostgreSQL for robust relational data management

**Payments:** Stripe API for secure transaction processing

**Deployment:** Vercel for automatic deployments and edge optimization

## Results

The platform successfully launched with three pilot businesses, processing over $50,000 in transactions in the first month. Page load times average under 2 seconds, and mobile conversion rates improved by 25% compared to clients' previous solutions.

Key learnings included the importance of optimistic UI updates for shopping cart interactions and the need for comprehensive error handling in payment flows. This project deepened my understanding of full-stack architecture and reinforced best practices for building production-ready applications.

### Testing

[Source: [testing-strategy.md](docs/architecture/testing-strategy.md)]

**Testing Requirements for this Story:**
- Manual verification:
  - Case study displays correctly on detail page
  - All sections render with proper formatting
  - Images load correctly
  - Typography is readable
  - Story flow makes sense
- Content review: Have peer or stakeholder read for clarity
- SEO check: Verify metadata is complete

### SEO Metadata

**Page Metadata (from MDX frontmatter):**
```tsx
export async function generateMetadata({ params }: { params: { slug: string } }) {
  const project = await getProjectBySlug(params.slug);
  return {
    title: `${project.title} | Your Name`,
    description: project.description,
  };
}
```

### Accessibility Considerations

**Content Accessibility:**
- Use clear, concise language
- Break up long paragraphs
- Use headings for structure
- Ensure code examples (if any) are properly formatted

### Integration with Story 3.1

**Dependencies:**
- Project detail template must be complete
- MDX system must be functional
- ProjectContent component renders markdown sections

### Integration with Future Stories

This case study provides:
- Content foundation for Story 3.3 (screenshots)
- Example for Story 3.5 (remaining case studies)
- Test case for Story 3.7 (image loading states)

### Project Selection Tips

**Good First Project Choices:**
- Full-stack application (shows breadth)
- Project with measurable results
- Work you're proud of and can discuss confidently
- Project that demonstrates problem-solving

**Avoid:**
- Tutorial projects without customization
- Projects without clear outcomes
- Overly simple applications
- Projects you can't explain technical decisions
