# Story 1.2: Set Up Git Repository and Version Control

## Status
Ready for Review

## Story

**As a** developer,
**I want** to initialize Git and create a GitHub repository,
**so that** I have version control and can enable automated deployments.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. Git repository initialized with .gitignore for Next.js
2. GitHub repository created (public or private as preferred)
3. Initial commit pushed with project foundation
4. README.md created with project description and setup instructions
5. Branch protection rules considered for main branch (optional for solo project)

## Tasks / Subtasks

- [x] Initialize Git repository with proper .gitignore (AC: 1)
  - [x] Run `git init` in project root directory
  - [x] Verify .gitignore file exists (created by create-next-app)
  - [x] Confirm .gitignore includes: node_modules/, .next/, .env.local, .vercel, *.log
  - [x] Add additional ignores if needed: .DS_Store, *.swp, .vscode/ (optional)

- [x] Create GitHub repository (AC: 2)
  - [x] Navigate to GitHub and create new repository
  - [x] Choose repository name: "personal-portfolio" or preferred name
  - [x] Select visibility: Public (recommended for portfolio) or Private
  - [x] Do NOT initialize with README, .gitignore, or license (already exists locally)
  - [x] Copy the remote repository URL

- [x] Create comprehensive README.md (AC: 4)
  - [x] Create README.md in project root with project title
  - [x] Add project description: "Modern portfolio website showcasing projects and skills"
  - [x] Include tech stack section: Next.js 14+, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, shadcn/ui
  - [x] Document setup instructions:
    - [x] Prerequisites: Node.js 18+, npm or yarn
    - [x] Installation steps: `npm install`
    - [x] Development command: `npm run dev`
    - [x] Build command: `npm run build`
  - [x] Add environment variables section (placeholder for future)
  - [x] Include deployment information (Vercel - to be configured in Story 1.3)

- [x] Create initial commit and push to GitHub (AC: 3)
  - [x] Stage all files: `git add .`
  - [x] Create initial commit: `git commit -m "Initial commit: Next.js project with TypeScript and Tailwind CSS setup"`
  - [x] Add remote origin: `git remote add origin <GitHub-URL>`
  - [x] Push to main branch: `git push -u origin main`
  - [x] Verify commit appears on GitHub repository page

- [x] Consider branch protection rules (AC: 5) - **Optional for later**
  - [x] Review if branch protection is needed for solo project (optional)
  - [x] If desired, enable on GitHub: Settings > Branches > Add rule
  - [x] Consider requiring pull request reviews (optional for solo work)
  - [x] Note: Can be configured later as project grows

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
[From Story 1.1]
- Project initialized with Next.js 14+, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS
- Folder structure created: /app, /components, /lib, /public
- Configuration files in place: tsconfig.json, tailwind.config.ts, .eslintrc.json, .prettierrc

### Git Workflow Requirements
[Source: [development-workflow.md](docs/architecture/development-workflow.md)]

**Version Control:**
- Git is the standard version control system
- GitHub serves as remote repository host
- Main branch serves as production-ready code

**Repository Structure:**
- Single monorepo for full-stack portfolio application
- All code, configuration, and documentation in one repository

### .gitignore Requirements
[Source: [unified-project-structure.md](docs/architecture/unified-project-structure.md)]

Standard Next.js .gitignore should include:
```
# dependencies
node_modules/
/.pnp
.pnp.js

# testing
/coverage

# next.js
/.next/
/out/

# production
/build

# misc
.DS_Store
*.pem

# debug
npm-debug.log*
yarn-debug.log*
yarn-error.log*

# local env files
.env*.local

# vercel
.vercel

# typescript
*.tsbuildinfo
next-env.d.ts
```

### README.md Structure

**Required Sections:**
1. Project Title and Description
2. Tech Stack
3. Prerequisites
4. Installation Instructions
5. Development Commands
6. Environment Variables (placeholder)
7. Deployment Information

### File Locations

Based on project structure:
- Git repository: Project root directory
- .gitignore: Root directory (created by create-next-app)
- README.md: Root directory
- .git/ folder: Root directory (created by `git init`)

### Testing

[Source: [testing-strategy.md](docs/architecture/testing-strategy.md)]

**Testing Requirements for this Story:**
- No automated tests required for version control setup
- Manual verification:
  - Confirm .gitignore excludes node_modules/ and .env.local
  - Verify initial commit appears on GitHub
  - Test git push/pull operations work correctly

### Technical Constraints

**Git Version:**
- Git 2.x or higher recommended
- Must have GitHub account for remote repository

**Repository Visibility:**
- Public recommended for portfolio (demonstrates work to potential employers)
- Private acceptable if code contains sensitive information

### Deployment Integration Notes

This story prepares the repository for Vercel deployment (Story 1.3). Vercel will automatically detect the GitHub repository and enable continuous deployment.

## Change Log

| Date | Version | Description | Author |
|------|---------|-------------|--------|
| 2025-10-02 | 1.0 | Initial story draft created | Scrum Master (Bob) |
