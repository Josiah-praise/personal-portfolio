# Story 2.2: Add Downloadable Resume/CV Feature

## Status
Ready for Implementation

## Story

**As a** recruiter,
**I want** to download the developer's resume in PDF format,
**so that** I can review credentials offline or share with team members.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. Resume PDF file stored in /public/resume folder
2. "Download Resume" button prominently displayed on About page
3. Button click triggers PDF download (not open in new tab)
4. PDF filename is professional (e.g., "John_Doe_Resume.pdf")
5. Button has clear icon (download symbol) and is visually distinct as CTA
6. Button is accessible (keyboard navigable, screen reader friendly)
7. File size is optimized (< 1MB)

## Tasks / Subtasks

- [ ] Prepare and optimize resume PDF (AC: 1, 4, 7)
  - [ ] Create or export resume as PDF
  - [ ] Use professional filename: `FirstName_LastName_Resume.pdf` (e.g., `John_Doe_Resume.pdf`)
  - [ ] Verify PDF is well-formatted and professional
  - [ ] Optimize file size: compress if > 1MB (use PDF optimizer tools)
  - [ ] Verify PDF opens correctly in multiple PDF readers
  - [ ] Create directory: `public/resume/`
  - [ ] Place PDF in: `public/resume/FirstName_LastName_Resume.pdf`

- [ ] Create DownloadButton component (AC: 2, 3, 5, 6)
  - [ ] Create `components/ui/download-button.tsx` or use inline in About page
  - [ ] Import Button from shadcn/ui: `import { Button } from '@/components/ui/button'`
  - [ ] Import Download icon from Lucide: `import { Download } from 'lucide-react'`
  - [ ] Create component with download link:
    ```tsx
    <Button asChild>
      <a
        href="/resume/FirstName_LastName_Resume.pdf"
        download="FirstName_LastName_Resume.pdf"
        aria-label="Download resume as PDF"
      >
        <Download className="mr-2 h-4 w-4" />

- [ ] Integrate download button into About page (AC: 2)
  - [ ] Open `app/about/page.tsx`
  - [ ] Import download button component or create inline
  - [ ] Place button prominently:
    - [ ] Option 1: Near top of page (below heading or intro)
    - [ ] Option 2: At end of experience section
    - [ ] Option 3: Both locations for visibility
  - [ ] Ensure button stands out visually (use "default" or "primary" variant)

- [ ] Style button for visual distinction (AC: 5)
  - [ ] Use Button variant: "default" for strong CTA
  - [ ] Add icon: Download icon from Lucide React
  - [ ] Ensure sufficient size and padding for clickability

- [ ] Deploy and verify live (AC: 1-7)
  - [ ] Commit changes: `git add .` and `git commit -m "Add downloadable resume feature to About page"`
  - [ ] Push to main: `git push origin main`

  - [ ] Test download button on production URL
  - [ ] Download PDF and verify it's correct file

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
[From Stories 1.1-1.6, 2.1]
- About page created at `app/about/page.tsx` with developer background
- shadcn/ui Button component available
- Lucide React icons library already installed (Story 1.6)
- Global layout and navigation in place

### Project Structure Requirements
[Source: [unified-project-structure.md](docs/architecture/unified-project-structure.md)]

**Static File Location:**
```
public/
├── resume/
│   └── FirstName_LastName_Resume.pdf
```

**Accessing Static Files:**
- Files in `/public` are served at root level
- Reference as: `/resume/filename.pdf` (not `/public/resume/...`)

### Button Component Usage
[Source: [components.md#ui-component-library-shadcnui](docs/architecture/components.md)]

**shadcn/ui Button:**
- Already installed in Story 1.4
- Import: `import { Button } from '@/components/ui/button'`
- Use `asChild` prop to render as anchor tag for download link

**Button Pattern for Downloads:**
```tsx
import { Button } from '@/components/ui/button';
import { Download } from 'lucide-react';

<Button asChild>
  <a
    href="/resume/filename.pdf"
    download="filename.pdf"
    aria-label="Download resume as PDF"
  >
    <Download className="mr-2 h-4 w-4" />
    Download Resume
  </a>
</Button>
```

### Download Attribute Behavior

**HTML5 Download Attribute:**
- `download` attribute forces browser to download file instead of navigating
- Can specify filename: `download="Custom_Name.pdf"`
- Supported by all modern browsers
- Fallback: Opens in new tab if download fails (acceptable behavior)

### Accessibility Requirements
[Source: [coding-standards.md#critical-fullstack-rules](docs/architecture/coding-standards.md)]

**Button Accessibility:**
- Keyboard accessible: Button must be focusable and activatable with Enter/Space
- Screen reader friendly: Add `aria-label` with descriptive text
- Visual focus indicator: Provided by Button component
- Touch-friendly: Minimum 44x44px touch target (Button component handles this)

### Icons Usage
[Source: [tech-stack.md](docs/architecture/tech-stack.md)]

**Lucide React Icons:**
- Already installed in Story 1.6
- Import: `import { Download } from 'lucide-react'`
- Usage: `<Download className="mr-2 h-4 w-4" />`
- Other relevant icons: FileText, File, ArrowDown

### File Size Optimization

**PDF Optimization:**
- Target: < 1MB file size
- Tools for compression:
  - Adobe Acrobat: "Reduce File Size"
  - Online tools: SmallPDF, iLovePDF
  - Mac Preview: Export → Reduce File Size
- Balance: Maintain readability vs. file size

### Coding Standards
[Source: [coding-standards.md](docs/architecture/coding-standards.md)]

**Component Best Practices:**
- Use TypeScript for any custom components
- Leverage shadcn/ui Button component
- Follow semantic HTML patterns
- Ensure accessibility compliance

### File Locations

Based on project structure:
- Resume PDF: `public/resume/FirstName_LastName_Resume.pdf`
- About page: `app/about/page.tsx` (already exists from Story 2.1)
- Optional component: `components/ui/download-button.tsx` or inline in page

### Testing

[Source: [testing-strategy.md](docs/architecture/testing-strategy.md)]

**Testing Requirements for this Story:**
- Manual verification:
  - Button appears on About page
  - Click triggers download (not navigation)
  - Downloaded file has correct name and content
  - Keyboard navigation works (Tab + Enter)
  - Button is visually distinct and easy to find
- Browser compatibility test: Chrome, Firefox, Safari
- Future: E2E test for download interaction

### SEO and Social Sharing Considerations

**Meta Tags (Optional):**
- PDF is not indexed by search engines
- No special meta tags needed for static PDF file
- Ensure About page meta description mentions resume availability

### Security Considerations

**Static File Serving:**
- PDF is publicly accessible (no authentication needed)
- Ensure PDF doesn't contain sensitive personal information (address, SSN, etc.)
- Vercel serves static files with appropriate caching headers

### Button Placement Strategy

**Recommended Placement:**
1. **Primary location:** Near top of About page (high visibility)
2. **Secondary location (optional):** End of experience section
3. **Alternative:** Sticky button or floating action button (if prominent CTA needed)

**Visual Treatment:**
- Use "default" Button variant for strong CTA
- Consider larger size: `size="lg"`
- Ensure sufficient spacing around button

### Integration with Future Stories

This download feature provides:
- Easy access to full credentials for recruiters
- Professional touch to portfolio
- Offline review capability for hiring teams
- Reduces friction in application process

### Technical Constraints

**Vercel Static File Limits:**
- No file size limit for static files in /public
- Files are served via CDN
- PDF will be cached for optimal performance

**Browser Support:**
- Download attribute supported in all modern browsers
- IE11 and older browsers may open PDF instead of downloading (acceptable fallback)
