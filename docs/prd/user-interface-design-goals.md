# User Interface Design Goals

## Overall UX Vision

The portfolio should feel professional, clean, and modern while reflecting the developer's personal brand and technical sophistication. The user experience prioritizes clarity and ease of navigation, allowing recruiters to quickly find key information (skills, projects, contact) while also inviting deeper exploration of project case studies for those who want detail. The design should demonstrate attention to detail and user-centric thinking through smooth interactions, clear hierarchy, and intuitive information architecture. Performance should be imperceptible - no loading spinners, no janky scrolling, just seamless content delivery.

## Key Interaction Paradigms

- **Scroll-based narrative:** Primary navigation uses smooth scrolling through sections on the homepage, with clear visual transitions between content areas
- **Progressive disclosure:** Project showcases present summary cards initially, expanding to full case studies on click/tap
- **Mobile-first interactions:** Touch-friendly targets (minimum 44x44px), swipe gestures for image galleries on mobile
- **Minimal cognitive load:** No more than 3 clicks to reach any information; clear call-to-action buttons (View Project, Download Resume, Contact Me)
- **Fast feedback:** Immediate visual feedback for all interactions (button states, form validation, loading indicators when necessary)
- **Accessibility-first:** Keyboard navigation fully supported, screen reader friendly, sufficient color contrast

## Core Screens and Views

- **Landing/Home Page:** Hero section with introduction, About preview, Featured Projects grid, Skills overview, Contact CTA
- **About Page/Section:** Full developer story, journey, values, downloadable resume
- **Project Detail Pages:** Individual pages or modals for each featured project with comprehensive case study
- **Contact Page/Section:** Contact form or clear contact information display
- **404/Error Page:** Branded error page with navigation back to home

## Accessibility: WCAG AA

The portfolio will meet WCAG 2.1 Level AA standards to ensure usability for people with disabilities and demonstrate professional commitment to inclusive design. This includes proper semantic HTML, sufficient color contrast ratios, keyboard navigation, focus indicators, alt text for images, and screen reader compatibility.

## Branding

Professional and modern aesthetic with clean typography and purposeful use of whitespace. Color scheme will be refined and professional (likely neutral base with one or two accent colors). Typography will use modern, highly legible system fonts or Google Fonts. Overall feel should be "confident, capable, approachable" - not flashy or over-designed, but showing good taste and technical polish.

## Target Device and Platforms: Web Responsive

The portfolio must provide excellent experience across:
- **Desktop:** 1024px and wider (primary experience for recruiters at work)
- **Tablet:** 768px-1023px (secondary, growing segment)
- **Mobile:** 320px-767px (significant traffic, especially for casual browsing)

All modern browsers supported (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge - latest 2 versions).
