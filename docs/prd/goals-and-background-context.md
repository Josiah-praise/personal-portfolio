# Goals and Background Context

## Goals

- Create a professional, high-performance portfolio website that effectively showcases developer skills and projects to potential employers and clients
- Achieve measurable career advancement through 3-5 quality inbound opportunities within 3 months of launch
- Establish strong personal brand presence with top 3 Google search rankings for "[Developer Name] + developer" within 6 months
- Demonstrate technical excellence through the portfolio itself (performance, accessibility, modern tech stack)
- Provide compelling project case studies that tell the story of problem-solving approach, not just code
- Enable easy discovery and contact by recruiters, hiring managers, and potential clients
- Build a scalable foundation that can evolve with the developer's career

## Background Context

Many developers struggle to stand out in today's competitive tech job market. Traditional resumes fail to capture the full breadth of capabilities, and scattered online presence across platforms like GitHub and LinkedIn makes it difficult for employers to assess real-world project quality and cultural fit. Generic portfolio templates lack personalization, and many existing portfolios suffer from poor performance, outdated design, or ineffective storytelling.

This portfolio addresses these challenges by serving as a centralized, professional showcase that combines technical demonstration with compelling narrative. By building a custom portfolio using modern frameworks and best practices, the developer proves their capabilities through the portfolio itself while making it easy for interested parties to discover their work, understand their approach, and initiate contact.
